## My VR Game
The game I plan on making is a very simple concept. It will be a first person game. The player is holding a dragon egg in one hand and a sword in the other hand. The player will have to make sure the egg doesn't move too quickly or it breaks while having to fend off enemies that are coming to destroy the egg. The player must walk forward in VR room space and walk to a certain point to complete the level. If the egg breaks the game is over and the player must restart.
