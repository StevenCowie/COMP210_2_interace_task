## My VR Game
The game I plan on making is a very simple concept. It will be a first person game. The player is holding a dragon egg in one hand and a sword in the other hand. The player will have to make sure the egg doesn't move too quickly or it breaks while having to fend off enemies that are coming to destroy the egg. The player must walk forward in VR room space and walk to a certain point to complete the level. If the egg breaks the game is over and the player must restart.
## Market Research
From my research I could not find any games similar to this. I do however believe in a couple of years when VR development is going to come a long way and it is possible that then a game like this could exist.
## Design
To design this game I initially wanted to use two vive trackers in each hand, one attatched to the egg which would be a rock and the other would be attatched to a stick which would function as your sword. However I found that the majority of the time I could only get one tracker, this wasn't too much of an issue as I just used the motion controller to be the sword, this did have a positive as it has build in vibration which is activated after you kill an enemy and I managed to make it feel like the controller handle was the sword by getting it in the right position.
